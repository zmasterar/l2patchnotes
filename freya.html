                  <p>Freya is a new raid boss for <em>Lineage II.</em> According to lore, Freya used to be a kind princess named Felicia. Her political enemies betrayed her, and in an attempt to kill her, she was transformed into Ice Queen Freya instead. Her loyal servant, Sirra, was transformed into Ice Fairy Sirra. Freya disappeared for years, during which time Ice Fairy Sirra ruled over the Frozen Labyrinth. Now that Freya has returned to power, Sirra is no longer a raid boss in <em>Lineage II.</em> Read more about Freya on the <a href="http://www.lineage2.com/freya"><em>Freya</em> preview site</a>.</p>

                  <p>The Seed of Annihilation is an enormous parasitic creature that absorbs bioenergy through its roots. Istina, the mother creator, is a conscious entity that inhabits the Seed. She has a symbiotic relationship with the land. She uses the energy that she siphons from the earth to create the creatures that inhabit her host. Reach this challenging and awe-inspiring area by flight or by airship from the Keucereus Alliance Base, located far to the south of the Gracia continent. See screenshots of the Seed of Annihilation on the <a href="http://www.lineage2.com/freya"><em>Freya</em> preview site</a>.</p>

                  <p>The Seed of Annihilation is split into three areas: Bistakon, Reptilikon, and Kokracon. Players can hunt in these areas at all times, regardless of the Seed's status.</p>
  
                  <p>Each area has its own raid boss. They appear are set times or can be triggered by continuous hunting in their area.</p>
  
                  <ul>
                      <li>Bistakon: Taklacan</li>
                      <li>Reptilikon: Torumba</li>
                      <li>Cokrakon: Dopagen</li>
                  </ul>
  
                  <p>Entering each of these areas also bestows a buff that lets players inflict additional damage on the local monsters, depending on their class type.</p>
  
                  <ul>
                      <li>The buffs are Efficacy of Strength (benefits melee classes), Efficacy of Agility (benefits archer classes), and Efficacy of Wisdom (benefits mage classes).</li>
                      <li>These buffs randomly are rearranged among the three areas at 1 p.m. CST every Monday. Thus, if Bistakon bestows the Efficacy of Strength buff one week, it will bestow a different buff the following week, and Efficacy of Strength will instead be available in one of the other two areas.</li>
                  </ul>
  
                  <p>Sealed Vesper materials can be obtained in the Seed of Annihilation.</p>
  
                  <p>The new Maguen Pet can only be obtained inside the Seed of Annihilation. Speak to NPC Nemo for more information. Nemo is in front of the airship dock controller, just outside of the Seed.</p>
  
                  <p>Maguen Plasma Buffs:</p>
  
                  <ul>
                      <li>Speak to NPC Nemo to receive the Maguen Plasma Collection device. When a monster is killed in the Seed of Annihilation, a Wild Maguen has a chance of appearing.</li>
                      <li>The Wild Maguen will display one of three different particle effects above its head. The color of each effect corresponds to the three different kinds of plasmas that can be collected and applied to a character as a buff using the Maguen Plasma Collection device. There are a large variety of plasma buffs.</li>
                      <li>The Wild Maguen will interact with only one randomly chosen party member. That character has 10 seconds to use the Maguen Plasma Collection device on the Wild Maguen. When the device is used, the character receives a plasma buff. Plasma buffs can be heightened in intensity, reaching up to level 3 of the buff, by collecting more plasma from more Wild Maguens. If a character gets to level 3 of a plasma buff, that individual buff has a chance to bestow a beneficial partywide buff.</li>
                      <li>Maguen Plasma Collection devices have a chance to overload on use and remove all the Maguen Plasma Buffs that have been collected so far.</li>
                      <li>While collecting Maguen plasmas, a Maguen Pet summoning item may drop randomly.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>The once empty area south of Oren is now populated with ranks upon ranks of Sel Mahum soldiers that are constantly training for battle. After losing territory battles with their cousins, the Oel Mahum, the Sel Mahum are planning to claim the Plains of the Lizardmen.</p>
                  
                  <p>Many Sel Mahum soldiers operate on a daily schedule of eating, training, and resting. Their behavior follows their schedule.</p>
  
                  <p>The Sel Mahum are trained to defend as a group. If one of them is attacked, all other Sel Mahums nearby come to the defense.</p>

                  <p>According to lore, the blood of the dragon Antharas has seeped into the ground of this area and transformed the local Lizardman population. The Tanta Lizardmen, as they are now called, are addicted to the toxic fumes emitted from strange glowing pillars.</p>
  
                  
  
                  <p>Characters in this zone experience the toxicity as a debuff: the Curse of the Plains. This debuff lowers a character's HP, but increases its bow/crossbow abilities.</p>
  
                  <p>Herbs dropped in this region do not land on the ground as items. Instead, the herb buff effects are applied automatically after your character kills a creature.</p>
  
                  <p>Certain lesser creatures in this area can help or hinder characters:</p>
  
                  <ul>
                      <li>The Rainbow Frog contains an enzyme that counteracts the Curse of the Plains.</li>
                      <li>The Energy Plant restores 70% of your character's health.</li>
                      <li>When you kill a Smash Fungus, all nearby monsters rush to the spot where it died and are dazed for a few seconds. Once the daze wears off, these monsters attack the characters that killed the Smash Fungus.</li>
                      <li>The Sticky Mushroom recovers 90% of a character's HP but causes immobility for 5 seconds.</li>
                  </ul>
  
                  <p>The area boss Tanta Seer Ugoros can be defeated by a character player. The battle with him involves both his attacker and Ugoros using certain herbs to heal or hinder each other. This boss is involved in two new quests.</p>

                  <p>This area was originally for level 63+ characters, but it has been adjusted to suit high-level characters, and a number of new quests have been added in the area.</p>
  
                  
  
                  <p>Crystal Spice and Golden Spice icons and prices in this area have changed. The range of the spice effects has increased. Monsters can now be farmed for either experience or for Adena/items depending on the type of feed used on them. Characters can now purchase spice packs that contain up to 50 spices and a chance to obtain special feed. Special feed allows a character a chance to tame a monster with only one application.</p>
  
                  <p>Grendels have been added to the list of monsters in this area that can be fed until they become temporary pets. Multiple tamed pets can now be used by a single character. To control tamed pets on the Beast Farm, the character must have a Bull Whip, which can be obtained for free from NPC Tunatun. Once a character has equipped the Bull Whip in a bracelet slot, it has access to four pet commands: Release, Release All, Follow, and Use Ability. Tamed beasts on the Beast Farm no longer heal or recharge.</p>

The mad scientist, Dr. Chaos, has arrived in the Pavel Ruins and become obsessed by his creature creations, the Golem Corps. Dr. Chaos also created the Golem Corps of Horrors with the help a young Dwarf girl named Dorothy.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Strip Mines area is appropriate for solo characters. In the Strip Mines, after a monster's death, it is likely that additional monsters will appear near the dead monster.</p>

After a prolonged period of prayer and meditation, the priests of Einhasad who follow St. Solina have foreseen the end of the world. These priests pray to the gods to prevent this destruction. As if in answer to their prayers, a new angel has appeared in the top level of the Monastery. Rumor also says that a treasure is hidden between the Room of Secrets and Savior Solina herself. Adventurers that covet the Holy Grail might be lucky enough to find it here.</p>
                  
                  <p>A new mini-game has been added to this zone that involves lighting nine torches in the correct order inside the Room of Secrets.</p>

                      <li>They can give you information on the new and revamped hunting areas, and prove direct teleports to these updated areas.</li>

                  <h4>Other Changes to Items</h4>
                  <p>New Life Stones have been added for use by characters that are level 85.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Regular/Mid-Grade/High-Grade/Top-Grade Life Stone</li>
                      <li>Accessory-type Life Stone</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>The weight of Spirit Ore has been reduced to 0.</p>
                  
                  <p>Inventory and quest inventory has changed so that a character's maximum item capacity for each inventory is separate. Now, characters can carry 100 quest Items without affecting or being affected by their regular inventory's item capacity.</p>
                  
                  <p>During the augmentation process, the amount of required gemstones is displayed in the Augment window.</p>
                  
                  <p>When using multiple magic accessories with the same territory name, only one of these items' attribute bonuses will apply. They cannot be stacked.</p>
  
                  <p>D-grade and C-grade Soulshots and Blessed Spiritshots can now be purchased from NPCs in certain towns. All of these shots are sold individually and not in bundles, unlike no-grade shot sales.</p>

              <div class="update">
  
                  <h4>New Emotes</h4>
                  <p>New social emotes allow two characters to participate in a dual emote. Characters can now exchange bows, high-five each other, and perform a synchronized couples dance. Go to the <a href="http://www.lineage2.com/freya"><em>Freya</em> preview site</a> to see a video of all three new emotes.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>These actions are initiated when one character targets another character and clicks on the social emote desired. The target character can then choose to accept or reject the action.</li>
                      <li>Slash commands can also be used to initiate the actions: /two-personbow, /hi-five, /coupledance.</li>
                      <li>When the distance between two characters is too far or too close, or there is an obstacle between them, the social emotes won't be performed.</li>
                      <li>When one character is in the process of performing some actions, such as PvP, a siege, the Olympiad, making a private store, using a workshop (manufacturing), or riding a pet, or if one character is in a transformation form, the social emote cannot be performed.</li>
                      <li>The Game System &gt; Options menu now has a Reject Couple Actions option. When checked, all couple emote requests are automatically declined.</li>
                  </ul>
  
                  <h4>Community Window</h4>
                  <p>Inside the in-game Community window, a new Homepage tab has been added. Clicking on the links on this tab open your web browser and take you to these pages on the official <em>Lineage II</em> website or forums. The links are:</p>

                      <li><a href="http://boards.lineage2.com/forumdisplay.php?f=219"><strong>Clan Recruitment Hall</strong></a>: A section on the forums where players can advertise and browse through clan listings and clan details in server-specific threads.</li>

                      <li>Screenshots are now placed in a Screenshots folder instead of in the System folder.</li>
                      <li>The mail system has been updated so that players can check mail and open some letters while outside of peace zones. However, characters may not send or receive mail with attached items while in a nonpeace zone.</li>

              <h2>11. Recommendation System</h2>
              <div class="update">
  
                  <p>The new recommendation system gives characters an additional XP rate bonus. It's a system based on recommendations, which are like points. Trade your recommendation points with others to increase each other's recommendation level and boost character XP rate!</p>
  
                  <h4>Summary</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The more recommendations a character has, the bigger its XP bonus is. The maximum is a 50% XP bonus for 1 hour.</li>

                  </ul>
  
                  <h4>How to Use Recommendations</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>You cannot recommend your own character.</li>
                      <li>You can recommend the same character continuously without restarting or relogging the game.</li>
                      <li>You will receive an XP bonus from the recommendations your character earns from other players (max 50%). The maximum recommendations a character can receive is 255.</li>
                  </ul>
  
                  
  
                  <h4>Bonus XP Time</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The bonus XP duration is 1 hour from the moment you log in.</li>
                      <li>When the duration expires, the XP boost effect ends, regardless of how many recommendations your character has.</li>
                  </ul>
  
                  <h4>Daily Initialization</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Every day at 6:30 a.m. Central Time (CT):

                              <li>The XP bonus time is reset to 1 hour.
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>This does not remove the Nevit's Sandglass effect.</li>
                                  </ul>

                  <p><em>Example 1:</em> Character A can give out 40 recommendations and also has 40 recommendations himself. He also has a XP bonus time of 0. After 6:30 a.m. CT, Character A has 0 recommendations to give out, 20 remaining recommendations in effect for his character, and 1 hour of XP bonus time remaining.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Example 2:</em> Character B can give out 1 recommendation and has 21 recommendations herself, and a XP bonus time of 40 minutes.

                      <li>This item grants additional XP bonus time. If, say, your character already has 30 minutes left on the daily recommendation XP bonus, which counts down as long as you are logged in, you can purchase this item to pause ("maintain") that countdown. During this time, your character gains XP at the level the bonus was paused at.</li>
                      <li>Cost: Depends on the character's XP level.</li>
                      <li>Stats: Maintains XP bonus time for 60, 90, 120, 150 or 180 minutes. (This number is decided randomly when the item is purchased.)</li>
                      <li>The item's effect is a buff that shows up in the new Recommendation System UI window as "Maintain."</li>
                      <li>Once the additional time runs out, the original XP bonus timer begins counting down once again.</li>
                      <li>This item has no cooldown time. However, you cannot use a second Sandglass if you already have the Nevit's Sandglass buff in effect.<br>

                      <li>The chart above explains the boundaries between different level ranges. This is important when wanting to repurchase a Nevit's Sandglass after your character levels up.</li>
                      <li>The repurchase delay is set at 20 hours, and this time is shared between all characters on the same account. However, if you level up in a way that goes from one level range to another level range (according to the chart above), the timer is 0. (See below for an example.)</li>
                      <li>You can only use the Sandglass that matches your character's level. If you purchase a Nevit's Sandglass when your character is level 79 (for example) and you have not used the Sandglass yet when your character levels up to 80, you cannot use the Sandglass that was purchased prior to leveling up.</li>
                      <li>If your character dies or changes its subclass, the Nevit's Sandglass buff disappears.</li>
                      <li>If your character teleports to an Olympiad arena or into an instance zone, Nevit's Sandglass buff disappears.</li>
                      <li>The Nevit's Sandglass buff cannot be stolen with Steal Divinity.</li>
                      <li>The recommendation system XP bonus stacks with Vitality bonuses.</li>

                  <p><em>Repurchasing Example 1:</em> Character A is level 63 and buys a Nevit's Sandglass. In less than 20 hours, he achieves level 64. Character A must wait until the rest of the 20 hours counts down before you can purchase another Nevit's Sandglass.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Repurchasing Example 2:</em> Character B is level 75 and buys a Nevit's Sandglass. In less than 20 hours, she achieves level 76. Because level 76 is in a different level range than the last Nevit's Sandglass she purchased, Character B can purchase a new Nevit's Sandglass right away that is tailored to her new level range.</p>
