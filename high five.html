 <h2 id="top">2. Grand Olympiad Enhancements</h2>
 
 <div class="update">

   <p>
     Grand Olympiad arenas have been changed to instanced zones. Matches can now be held in 160 stadiums at the same time.
   </p>

   <p>
     <strong>Participant and Audience Limits</strong> The minimum number of participants for a match changed. Additionally, now all characters that have requested a match can enter the stadium.
   </p>

   <table border="1">
     <tbody><tr>
       <th>Match Type</th>
       <th>Current Participant Limit</th>
       <th>Previous Participant Limit</th>
     </tr>

       <td>Class-irrelevant Team</td>
       <td>6 teams</td>
       <td>9 teams</td>
     </tr>
   </tbody></table>

   <p>The maximum number of people who can watch a match at the same time increased to 18 per stadium.</p>
   <p>The waiting period between matches decreased to 25 seconds (was 45 seconds).</p>
   <p>You now cannot request a match if your character's inventory or weight is above 80%.</p>

   <h4>Camera and Replay Viewing</h4>
   <p>With the new Camera Mode, characters can move about freely while watching Grand Olympiad matches. For more information about this new mode, press the <strong>Help</strong> button while viewing a match.</p>
   <p>A Replay function has been added to allow spectators to record a match and play it back later.</p>

   <h4>Participant Matching</h4>
   <p>The previous system in which opponents were selected randomly has been changed to a system in which opponents with similar Olympiad points are matched first. Points are now accumulated by:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>10 points for reaching Noblesse for the first time.</li>
     <li>10 more points every week.</li>
     <li>A total of 50 points given to every character during each Olympiad cycle.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Noblesse Characters</h4>
   <p>Noblesse characters can now join only up to a set number of matches per week. This maximum number resets at the beginning of each Olympiad cycle.</p>

   <ul>
     <li>Total Matches: 70 maximum</li>
     <li>Class-Irrelevant Individual Matches: 60 maximum</li>
     <li>Class Individual Matches: 30 maximum</li>
     <li>Class-Irrelevant Team Matches: 10 maximum</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Noblesse characters can us the <strong>/olympiadstat</strong> command on other characters to check a targeted character's Olympiad points, personal record, and remaining number of matches.</p>

   <h4>New Stadiums and Stadium Changes</h4>
   <p>The appearance of the Olympiad stadium has changed into a rectangular grassy arena surrounded by a coliseum-like building. The sky in this arena changes randomly.</p>

   <p>Three new stadiums have been added:</p>


   <table border="1">
     <tbody><tr>

       <td>This square stadium contains a stone statue at its east, west, south, and north sides. These stone statues block the gates from which participants enter, making this mid-sized stadium look even smaller.</td>

   </tbody></table>

   <ul>

   <p>When certain raid bosses are killed, they now drop the weapon they or their minions were wearing. The names of these raid boss weapons are displayed in purple font color. The stats of each of these weapons are the same as the stats of the weapon of the same grade.</p>
   <p>These weapons can be traded, dropped, sold through a private shop or NPC shop, and crystallized. Bestowing a special ability, augmenting, enchanting, converting to a PvP-type weapon, and adding elemental attributes are all possible.</p>
   <p>These weapons can only be acquired through Raid Boss hunting. Crafting is not possible.</p>

           <h2>4. Revamped Hunting Grounds and Raid Bosses</h2>

           <div class="update">

             <p>Antharas' Lair and Dragon Valley have been revamped. New Separated Soul NPCs live in Hunter's Village, Dragon Valley, and Antharas' Lair that can teleport characters level 80 and above between each of these areas. Separated Soul NPCs also offer daily quests for their related zones and can synthesize certain items into Antharas Blood Crystals:</p>
             <ul>
               <li><strong>Will of Antharas:</strong> Can be obtained from the Raid Boss monsters in Antharas' Lair.</li>
               <li><strong>Sealed Blood Crystal:</strong> Can be obtained from the raid boss monster in Dragon Valley.</li>
             </ul>

             <p>Because Antharas' Lair and Dragon Valley have been revised, certain quests are no longer available or their related monsters have moved:</p>
             <ul>
               <li>Power of Darkness (level 55)</li>
               <li>Whisper of Dreams - Part 1 (level 56)</li>
               <li>Whisper of Dreams - Part 2 (level 60)</li>
             </ul>

             <p>If a quest you were working on was removed when High Five launched, you can complete it and receive rewards for it by speaking to the <a href="/news/highfive_13.html">News Informer NPC</a>. With the exception of the quests mentioned above, any monsters related to quests in Antharas' Lair and Dragon Valley are now located in Watcher's Tomb. To view where quest monsters appear, check the quest map pin in your map window.</p>

             <p>The soldiers of Aden have long been collecting the cursed bones of watchmen that died miserably in the valley of the Land Dragon Antharas. Because of this, the Blood Curse affects fewer undead monsters, and the number of soldiers taking aim at Antharas has been increased. In response, Antharas has summoned additional ferocious monsters near his nest to keep those infiltrators in check.</p>
             <p>Some geographical features inside Antharas' Lair have changed. New monsters have also been added. Antharas' Lair is now home to new raid bosses, include Drake Lord, Dragon Beast, and Behemoth Leader. Also, a new and fearsome Knorik monster can show up during raids and patrol inside Antharas' Lair. A successful Spoil attack on certain monsters in Antharas' Lair can generate a Morale Boost buff.</p>
             <p>Various new <a href="/news/highfive_07.html">quests</a> involving Antharas, the monsters in his nest, and items useful to an Antharas raid have been added.</p>
             <p>When entering Antharas' nest through the Heart of Warding, your Portal Stone is no longer consumed. Antharas' HP regeneration and overall stats have been reduced. The casting time for major skills used by Antharas has been increased. Fewer Dragon Helpers, Behemoth Dragons and Tarask Dragons are summoned during an Atharas raid. And the stats for the Tarask Dragon have been reduced. When Antharas is defeated, <a href="/news/highfive_05.html">Nevit's Herald</a> appears in all towns.</p>
             <p>During an Antharas Raid, a Antharas Blood Crystal can resurrect dead allies and fully restore their experience points. This item only works (or is useful) during an Antharas Raid. New helpful items that can be obtained from <a href="/news/highfive_07.html">quests</a> and used during an Antharas raid have been added.</p>

             <p>Certain older monsters in Dragon Valley have been moved to Watcher's Tomb.</p>
             <p>Earthquakes can strike Dragon Valley at random times and locations. During an earthquake, special monsters show up in groups.</p>
             <p>The Large Dragon Bone item, which you can obtain in this zone, summons particular raid boss monsters. Use the item on a Dragon Vortex found in four places inside Dragon Valley to summon and hunt the following raid boss monsters:</p>

               <li>Muscle Bomber</li>
               <li>Dust Rider</li>
             </ul>

             <p>You can randomly obtain either MP Herbs or the Morale Boost buff if a Spoil attack lands successfully on some monsters.</p>

             <ul>
               <li><strong>Morale Boost Buff Level 1:</strong> Increased Paralysis/Bleed/Poison/Stun Resistance by 50, Critical Rate by 10%, and Critical Power by 10%. The buff only remains while you are in Dragon Valley.</li>

             <h4>Revamped Raid Bosses</h4>

             <p><strong>Fire Dragon Valakas:</strong> The Floating Stone that was required to enter the Hall of Flames through Klein, the Watcher of Valakas, has been renamed to the Vaculalite Floating Stone. It is no longer consumed when you use it to enter the Hall of Flames.<br>
               Valakas' HP regeneration and overall stats have been reduced. The casting time for major skills used by Valakas has been increased. The power for major skills used by Valakas has been adjusted.<br>
               The number of Lavasaurus Helpers summoned by Valakas during the battle has been reduced. Lavasaurus Helpers' overall stats and skill power has been reduced, and these creatures can now be hunted.<br>
               When Valakas is defeated, <a href="/news/highfive_05.html">Nevit's Herald</a> appears in all towns.<br>
               Various new <a href="/news/highfive_07.html">quests</a> involving Valakas, the monsters in his nest, and providing items useful to a Valakas raid have been added.<br>

                     <img src="/news/images/luckypig.png" alt="Lucky Pig" align="right">

                     <p>While hunting in certain zones, you can encounter the Lucky Pig.  (It has replaced the Fortune Bug.) Lucky Pig is a flying pig with white feathery wings. When it appears, it shouts and approaches a nearby character at random.<br>
                       Lucky Pig eats Adena dropped nearby and disappears if not fed for 10 minutes. You can feed Adena to Lucky Pig a minimum of three times and a maximum of ten times. Talk to it to determine if it's full. When it is full, Lucky Pig loses its wings. At that point, it may give you a reward for feeding it.<br>
                       You can obtain a reward either by feeding Lucky Pig ten times or talking to it after you have fed it at least three times.</p>

                       <h4>Lucky Pig Locations:</h4>
                       <ul>
                         <li><em>Level 52 Lucky Pig:</em> Enchanted Valley.</li>
                         <li><em>Level 70 Lucky Pig:</em> Forest of the Dead, Valley of Saints.</li>
                         <li><em>Level 80 Lucky Pig:</em> Wild Beast Pastures, Plains of the Lizardmen, Sel Mahum Training Grounds, Fields of Whispers &amp; Silence, Crypts of Disgrace, Den of Evil, Primeval Isle, and the solo area in Dragon Valley.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <h4>Lucky Pig Rewards:</h4>

                       <ul>
                         <li><em>Level 52 Lucky Pig:</em> Neolithic Crystal B and Top-Grade Life Stone - Level 52.</li>
                         <li><em>Level 70 Lucky Pig:</em> Neolithic Crystal A and Soul Crystals - Stage 11.</li>
                         <li><em>Level 80 Lucky Pig:</em> Neolithic Crystal S and Attribute crystals.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <p>You can exchange Neolithic Crystals with a Dimensional Merchant to change a normal weapon into a rare weapon. (Dimensional Merchants are now functional.) To change a weapon into a rare weapon, you need to supply the Dimensional Merchant with the weapon and 1 Neolithic Crystal of the same grade.</p>

                       <h4>Treasure Chests</h4>

                       <p>Hunting grounds throughout Aden now have fewer Treasure Chests, but the rewards they give are better. They can only be opened through the Unlock skill or the newly added Maestro Key. (They can no longer be opened with Treasure Chest Keys.) The Maestro Key can be purchased from Grocer NPCs in each village or obtained through the Summon Treasure Key skill.</p>
                       <p>Treasure Chest rewards depend on both your character's level and the level of the Treasure Chest:</p>
                       <ul>
                         <li>If your character is level 77 or below, you can receive rewards from Treasure Chests within six levels of your character level. For example, if you are level 77, you can get rewards from Treasure Chests of levels 71 through 83 only.</li>
                         <li>If your character is level 78 or higher, you can receive rewards from Treasure Chests within five levels of your character level. For example, if you are level 78, you can get rewards from Treasure Chests of levels 73 through 83 only.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <p>If you get no rewards from a Treasure Chest, the chest self-destructs and disappears.</p>
                       <p>If you are very lucky, you can obtain an Adventurer's Treasure Sack from a Treasure Chest. The three types of Adventurer's Treasure Sack you can receive are related to the level of the Treasure Chest.
                       </p><ul>
                       <li><strong>Beginner Adventurer's Treasure Sack: </strong> One random D-Grade or C-Grade weapon.</li>
                       <li><strong>Experienced Adventurer's Treasure Sack: </strong> One random B-Grade, A-Grade, or S-Grade weapon (excluding Dynasty).</li>
                       <li><strong>Great Adventurer's Treasure Sack: </strong> One random Dynasty, Icarus, or Vesper weapon.</li>

                   <h2>5. Nevit's Advent Blessing</h2>

                   <div class="update">

                     <p><em>The swelling number of Shilen's followers and the immeasurable power of their prayers gradually led to the day of Shilen's resurrection. The angel Nevit calmly watched these events unfold, and one day, he shot the Arrow of Light down from the heavens. The Arrow held within it a vision of himself that served to bolster religious devotion to Einhasad, the nemesis of Shilen. Those affected by vision of Nevit became inspired by the power of the light.</em></p>
                     <p>The Hunting Bonus and its resulting Nevit's Advent Blessing are a new Vitality boost system that is a part of the Nevit's Blessings system, which also includes the Recommendation system. It automatically affects all characters logged in. This system gives a character Vitality-related boosts in direct relation to experience point gain.</p>
                     <p>Details on your character's current Hunting Bonus can be found in the game interface in the Nevit's Blessings window. This same window also houses details for the Recommendation system.</p>
                     <p>The bar below the words "Hunting Bonus" is the Hunting Bonus gauge. The gauge fills as a character gains experience points (or due to special circumstances). Once the gauge reaches 100%, your character receives Nevit's Advent Blessing. When Nevit's Advent Blessing activates, a sound effect, visual effects, and messages both on the screen and in the system messages of your chat window indicate it. A red light glows around your character and the wings icon blinks next to your full Hunting Bonus gauge.</p>
                     <p>The effect of Nevit's Advent Blessing lasts 3 minutes, after which time the red glow disappears and the Hunting Bonus gauge is reset.</p>
                     <p>The Nevit's Advent Blessing gives the following Vitality boosts all at once:</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li><strong>Vitality Recovery:</strong> Regardless of your character's current Vitality level, the character receives an experience point bonus equivalent to Vitality level 4. This effect does not stack with other Vitality recovery items.</li>
                       <li><strong>Vitality Replenishing:</strong> Your character gains Vitality as it gains experience points while hunting (similar to if your character were under the effect of a Vitality Replenishing Herb). This effect does not stack with other Vitality replenishing buffs or items.</li>
                       <li><strong>Negated Death Penalty:</strong> No experience points are lost upon death.</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p>The Hunting Bonus gauge is filled by:</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li><strong>Gaining experience points from hunting.</strong> Experience points gained from quests do not apply.</li>
                       <li><strong>Leveling up.</strong> Each time your character levels up, the Hunting Bonus gauge gets a big boost. The amount of this boost is the same each time. It is not dependent on level.</li>
                       <li><strong>Being logged in while the Hunting Bonus timer is activated.</strong> Similar to the Recommendation system timer, the Hunting Bonus timer is activated as soon as your character kills a monster and receives experience points. As long as the Hunting Bonus timer is active, your character slowly accumulates points while they are logged in. The Hunting Bonus timer lasts 4 hours and can only be activated once per day. Every day at 6:30 a.m. (server time), your character's use of the Hunting Bonus timer is reset, and you can activate the timer once again. When the Hunting Bonus timer is active, the gradual and automatic increase to the Hunting Bonus gauge continues. The slow and automatic increase of the gauge thanks to the Hunting Bonus timer continues even when a character is dead.</li>
                       <li><strong>Being randomly visited by the angel Nevit.</strong> While hunting, the angel Nevit can randomly bless your character. Nevit will give your character a visible boost to its Hunting Bonus gauge. The arrival of the angel Nevit is announced in the system messages.</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p>The Hunting Bonus and Nevit's Advent Blessing apply to both normal and chaotic characters. Chaotic characters with 6 or more PK points are given an item drop penalty.</p>
                     <p>The Hunting Bonus gauge applies to each respective character. Its state is preserved across Subclass Changes or Subclass Separations.</p>
                     <p>The Hunting Bonus gauge does not activate or grow from gaining experience points from monsters that are nine levels or more below your character or from gaining experience points while inside a Peace Zone.</p>
                     <p>If active, the Hunting Bonus timer pauses when your character enters a Peace Zone or becomes disconnected from the server.</p>



                     <h4> Nevit's Herald</h4>
                     <p>When Antharas or Valakas are defeated, Nevit's Herald appears in all towns and remains for 3 hours.</p>
                     <p>Nevit's Herald can grant your character the Fall of the Dragon buff, which freezes your Recommendation and Hunting Bonus timers for 3 hours, letting you enjoy these bonuses longer.</p>

                       The name search function is case sensitive. Clicking on a name displays the character's class, shows its current location, and shows if it is in an instanced dungeon.<br>
                       You can now check the name and class of the members in a particular party matching room from outside. Click on a party matching room listing to display the name and class type icon of the members in that room.</p>

                                 <h4>Other Quests Changes</h4>

                                 <p>When you accept a quest, the game system examines your character's inventory and quest inventory to determine if your character has enough free inventory space for the quest item or items. Previously, if the combination of both inventories was 80% full, you could not accept the quest. This percentage has increased to 90%.<br>
                                   <strong>Noblesse Quest Series: </strong> The Noblesse quest series has been reworked and is easier to complete.</p>
                                   <ul>
                                     <li><em>Possessor of a Precious Soul - 1:</em> The acquisition rate of the Malruk Succubus Claw and Scarlet Moss items has increased. Taik Orc Supply Leader - Cemetery monsters now drop Scarlet Moss (rather than Splinter Stakato Drones). The request from the Head Blacksmith in the Town of Goddard, Noel, has been removed and is no longer available.</li>
                                     <li><em>Possessor of a Precious Soul - 3:</em> The acquisition rate of the Ring of the Goddess: Waterbinder and the Necklace of the Goddess: Evergreen has doubled. A character can now obtain the Rain Song Staff of the Goddess through one of two methods. (Previously, the only method to obtain the Rain Song Staff of the Goddess was through Barakiel, the Flame of Splendor raid boss.)
                                       <ul>
                                         <li>Method 1: Obtain the Rain Song Staff of the Goddess through Barakiel, the Flame of Splendor raid boss.</li>
                                         <li>Method 2: Hunt Wailing of Splendor, Fang of Splendor, Crown of Splendor, and Shout of Splendor monsters to collect 100 Fragments of Rain Song Staff of the Goddess.</li>
                                       </ul>

                                   <p><strong>Repetitious Dialog Window Selection Eliminated:</strong> The inconvenient process of having to select a dialog window over and over again to receive quest rewards is now gone. These quests now have an updated reward system:</p>
                                   <ul>

                                   <p>A Birthday Present box is now delivered on the character's birthday via the in-game mail system. The original birthday gift NPC, Alegria, now simply mails the Birthday Present boxes. (She will also exchange an Explorer Hat for a Birthday Hat.) Previously, she gave out a Birthday buff and the Explorer Hat.<br>
                                     As long as a player logs on to the birthday character within 14 days from the birthday date, the Birthday Present is delivered via the mail system. The letter with the Birthday Present attached remains in a character's inbox for 14 days after the character's birthday. If unopened, it is deleted on the 15th day.<br>
                                     The Birthday Present box contains:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                       <li><strong>Birthday Hat:</strong> Previously, the hat to celebrate a character's birthday was the Explorer Hat. Instead, Birthday Hats now celebrate a character's birth. The Explorer Hat is no longer available.</li>
                                       <li><strong>3 Birthday Vitality Potions:</strong> Each potion gives a Vitality Boost effect for 4 hours. The Birthday Vitality Potion buff persists after death until it expires. If you use a Subclass Change or Subclass Separation account service on a character that has an ongoing Birthday Vitality Potion buff in place, the buff is gone after the account service has completed.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Birthday Cake:</strong> The Birthday Cake effect lasts for 20 minutes and casts a 5-minute Vitality-maintaining buff on nearby party members. If Birthday Cake is eaten on a ship/airship, the Birthday Cake is consumed and the Birthday Cake effect does not occur. (So avoid using Birthday Cake on a ship/airship.)</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p>The 5th Anniversary Message is no longer displayed in the new birthday system.</p>
