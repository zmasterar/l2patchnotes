<b><h1>Gracia Final</h1></b>

<h2>1. Territory War</h2>
  
        <p>Territory battles, unlike castle sieges whenre the battles are led by clans, is a new PvP concept in which clanless and casual players can have an effect on the supremacy of a continent by participating as a 'mercenary' in disputes between territories.</p>
        
        <h4>Territory</h4>
        <p>Castle ownership has been expanded into territory ownership.  Where previously a castle was the highest form of ownership available, this facet of game play has been expanded to include the castle, the local town/village and the nearby hunting grounds. This new territory system will foster a complimentary relationship between clans and general users, boost economic profits, and increase the influence that both clans and casual users have in the development of the land.</p>
  
        <h4>Territory Components</h4>
        <p>A territory consists of a castle, the corresponding town or village, territory fortress and hunting ground. There are presently 9 existing territories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gludio</li>
          <li>Dion</li>
          <li>Giran</li>
          <li>Oren</li>
          <li>Aden</li>
          <li>Innadril</li>
          <li>Goddard</li>
          <li>Rune</li>
          <li>Schuttgart</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>Territory War: Pre Battle</h4>
        <p>At the end of a castle siege, the corresponding territory enters Territory War standby status.  This is automatically done by the system and following changes will occur:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A Territory Manager NPC appears within the castle's corresponding village/town.  The Territory Manager will be stationed near the Manor Manager of each town. A Territory Manager sells territory specific products that can be purchased using Territory Badges as partial currency.</li>
          <li>A Mercenary Captain NPC appears within the castle's corresponding village/town.  The Mercenary Captain will be stationed near the Manor Manager of each town. One can participate in a territory war as a mercenary through the Mercenary Captain.  In addition, this NPC also sells various items which can be used during a territory battle.  He also offers a quest that allows the player to raise one's mercenary rank.</li>
        </ol>
          
        <h4>Proclaiming Lord</h4>
        <p>After the territory becomes Territory War standby status, the castle lord can then proceed with the 'Path to Becoming a Lord' quest.  This quest is offered by each castle Chamberlain.  Conditions for being proclaimed as lord are as follows:</p>
        <h5>Conditions for proclaiming a territory lord</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>The castle should have either no relation or contract status with all player owned fortresses in the territory (excluding a border fortress).  If a fortress has claimed its independence within the territory, then the lcastle lord cannot be proclaimed as lord of the territory.</li>
          <li>One has to complete the 'Path to Becoming a Lord' quest.</li>
          <li>One has to complete the quest 2 hours prior to the start of the territory war.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>The following changes occur when a territory lord is proclaimed:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Being proclaimed as territory lord is a necessary condition to expand a clan's level to 11.</li>
          <li>The territory lord's clan emblem is automatically registered to all NPC's residing within their territory.</li>
          <li>10% increase in seed sales and crop purchases.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Territory lord proclamation will automatically be cancelled under following situations:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>When the clan is disbanded.</li>
          <li>When the lord is changed at the end of a castle siege</li>
          <li>When proclaiming lord is cancelled, all activated functions will be initialized.</li>
        </ol>
  
        <h4>Territory War: Battle</h4>
  
        <h5>Cycle and Beginning</h5>
        <p>Territory wars will occur one day before the castle sieges and will have the same 2 week cycle. To accommodate this, the castle siege schedule will be modified.  All territory wars will occur on Saturday from 20:00 - 22:00 CST. All castle sieges are being moved to Sundays from 16:00 - 18:00 and from 20:00 - 22:00 CST.</p>
  
        <h5>Occurrence of Territory Battle</h5>
        <p>Upon the completion of a castle siege, territory status is automatically given to the winning clan.  The territory war will begin on the designated date/time, regardless of whether the castle-owning clan leader has been declared as lord.  Being declared as the lord of the territory is done through a specific quest.  And it is only after being proclaimed as territory lord that you are able to participate in a territory war.</p>
  
        <h5>Register to Participate</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>To particpate, players must register through the Mercenary Captain of their chosen territory.
          </li><li>Whether you are in a clan or not, anyone outside of that territory's castle owning clan can register for participation.  You can register either as an individual, or you can register your entire clan at once.
            <ul>
              <li>Any clan member who has the appropriate clan permissions can register their clan in a territory war.
              </li><li>Individual particpants who want to join as mercenaries must register for themselves.
              </li><li>Only characters level 40 and above who have completed their 2nd class transfer can participate in a territory war.
            </li></ul>
          </li><li>Territory War registration and cancellation end 2 hours before the battle begins.
          </li><li>Registration can be cancelled in the same way it is requested.  When you speak to a Mercenary Captain, the button that you push (Merc Request) to register will then toggle to Merc. Cancel.  So if you wish to cancel your registration, simply click the button again.
          </li><li>Castle owning clans will automatically be registered.
        </li></ol>
  
        <h5>Beginning of Territory Battle</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Once a territory battle begins, the castle, ther area surrounding the castle and the territory fortress area are changed to the battlefield. Any nonparticipating characters who are located in these areas will be teleported away once the battle begins.</li>
          <li>The clan lord of the territory can build a headquarters or outpost on the battlefield during a territory war.</li>
          <li>The other participating clan lords can build a headquarters only.</li>
          <li>Closed fortress and castle gates are attackable during a territory war.</li>
          <li>The territory channel is automatically activated 20 minutes before the beginning of battle.
            <ul>
              <li>This territory is automatically terminated 10 minutes after the territory battle is over.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Territory Ward and Supplies Safe can be found insides each castle.  The Territory Catapult is found in the territory fortress.</li>
        </ol>
  
        <h5>Battle Rules</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Basic rules for a territory war are similar to the rules for a castle siege: participants are divided according to friendly force, enemy, and non-affiliated.  Each particpating territory has its own territory icon, differentiating friendly and enemy forces.  Non-affiliated forces bear no icon above their head during the war.</li>
          <li>Friendly forces include clan members who belong to the same territory, other registered clans and registered mercenaries.</li>
          <li>Clan members who belong to different territories are automatic enemies to one another once a territory war has begun.</li>
          <li>Any players who are not registered in the territory war are considered non-affiliated.</li>
          <li>All registered particpants are marked with a territory symbol above their head.  This will allow for ease of recognition on the battlefield.</li>
          <li>Force attack is not needed while on a battlefield during a territory war.  Upon targeting an enemy, your cursor will automatically give you the sword icon.  Friendly forces cannot be attacked, not even with force attack.</li>
          <li>The range attack causes damage to those who are the friendly force and non-affiliated. AOE skills will affect all enemy and non-affiliated forces on the battlefield.</li>
          <li>PK counts are not applied while on the battlefield.</li>
          <li>There is no PK penalty because the clan battle status is maintained even though enemies go outside of the battlefield.</li>
          <li>Any player who leaves the battlefield area during a territory war will be flagged (purple) for 120 seconds.</li>
          <li>When a registered player dies on the battlefield during a territory war, they will not incur a loss of experience points or item drops.</li>
          <li>If a non-affiliated (unregistered) player dies on the battlefield, they will incur the same penalty that is received for dying on a General Field.</li>
          <li>Any players who are registered in the territory battle will have the option of restarting in the following areas:
            <ul>
              <li>Residence district within the castle and 1st village</li>
              <li>Residence district within the castle and 1st - Camp and outpost</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
  
        <h5>Outpost</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>A clan lord who owns a castle can now build an Outpost during a territory war.</li>
          <li>When a clan lord builds an Outpost, 30 MP and 120 'B-grade gemstones' are consumed.</li>
          <li>Only one Outpost can be constructed at a time. The lord will also have a skill allowing them to demolish their outpost, thus allowing the player to move their outpost at will during the territory war. However, please note that each construction attempt will still cost the items listed above.</li>
          <li>Other players cannot destroy an outpost, nor can an outpost be repaired.</li>
          <li>HP/MP recovery rate for all friendly forces who are located near an outpost will increase by 100%.</li>
          <li>Any participants who die in the territory battle can restart at an outpost or camp. This includes mercenaries.</li>
          <li>When a territory battle is over, all outposts and headquarters disappear.</li>
        </ol>
  
        <h5>Conditions for Winning (3)</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Territory Ward - once a territory battle begins, territory wards are placed inside of all castles where their territories are proclaimed.</li>
          <li>Once you destroy an opposing castle's territory ward, the ward is immediately equipped on your character.
            <ul>
              <li>Once you are equipped with a territory ward, you must make your way to your clan's outpost and use the Capture Ward skill.  This will place the ward inside your territory's castle.
              </li><li>The location of the player who acquires a territory ward can be found on the mini map.</li>
              <li>When the territory battle ends, the ownership of a territory ward returns to the original castle under the following conditions:
                <ul>
                  <li>When a player has a ward equipped, but hasn't gotten it back to their castle.</li>
                  <li>When the ward is laying on the ground, unclaimed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Any wards successfully taken from other territories will remain in the castle that captured it until the next territory battle.  If a castle loses their ward, they must retake it during the next territory war.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Territory Catapult - When a territory battle begins, the territory catapult spawns in the 1st territory fortress.  The 1st territory fortress will be designated with a blue flag on your map.
            <ul>
              <li>The territory catapult can be attacked by enemies.</li>
              <li>When the territory catapult is destroyed, all defense NPCs and all defense functions of the castle  will disappear and all castle gates are opened.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>Mercenary</h5>
        <p>All territory battle participants, excluding castle owning clan members, will be guaranteed their anonymity in a territory battle through the following methods:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Disguise Scrolls
            <ul>
              <li>In order to maintain individual anonymity, players registered as mercenaries can purchase a Disguise Scroll from the Territory Manager.  When used, a Disguise Scroll changes the characters name to 'Guardian' in preparation for the territory battle.  The territory for which they are fighting will appear before the word Guardian.  For example: if I am fighting for Aden Castle and use a Disguise Scroll, my name will appear as Aden Guardian.
              </li><li>A Disguise Scroll can be used 20 minutes prior to the start battle and will last until 10 minutes after the territory battle ends.
              </li><li>Each Disguise Scroll lasts for 30 minutes.
              </li><li>Character names displayed in chat and combat system messages are also changed. However, the original character name will be displayed in trade windows and private messages.
              </li><li>The changed name will be maintained even if one dies or disconnects.
              </li><li>One cannot create a private store (buy or sell) or create a dwarven workshop while one is using the disguise scroll.
              </li><li>Chaotic characters (including players who have a cursed sword) and Olympiad participants cannot use Disguise Scrolls during Territory War.
            </li></ul>
          </li>
          <li>Mercenary Transformation
            <ul>
              <li>All territory battle participants can purchase the Mercenary Transformation Scroll through a Mercenary Captain.  However, only registered particpants outside of the castle owning clan can use this item.
              </li><li>When a player has been transformed by a Mercenary Transformation Scroll and is in a party, neither the mercenary or the other party members will be able to accummulate Exp or SP.  However, Fame Points can still be acquired by the mercenary.
              </li><li>By completing the Path to Becoming a Mercenary quest, you will receive an Elite Mercenary Certificate.  This certificate will allow you to purchase a wider variety of items thorugh the Mercenary Captain.
              </li><li>The mercenary transformation will last for 30 minutes, and the transformation will not be cancelled even if one dies during the war.
              </li><li>A Mercenary Transformation Scroll can be used 20 minutes prior to the start of a territory battle.
              </li><li>Chaotic characters (including players who have a cursed sword) and Olympiad participants cannot use a Mercenary Transformation during Territory War.
            </li></ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Territory War: Post Battle</h4>
        <h5>Territory Specific Rewards</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Each of the nine territories has a specific territory skill associated with it.  These skills are called Territory Benefactions.</li>
          <li>When a territory battle ends, the territory skill is applied to all clan members of the castle owning clan (excluding academy members).  For example:  If the lord of Aden is able to acquire territory wards for Aden, Rune, and Giran, all clan memebers associated with Aden castle will gain the passive territory skill.</li>
          <li>One has to own the territory ward of one's own territory in order to be acquire the Benefaction skills.</li>
          <li>Even if a different clan lord is delegated, a territory wards and ownership for the corresponding territory do not change.</li>
          <li>Ownership of each territory ward can be found through Mini map -&gt; World Information -&gt; Territory Battle Information.  The territory icons next to each clan denote who possesses which wards.</li>

        <p>Note: The Enchanter designation refers to buffer-type classes (example: Prophet.)</p>
        
        <h4>Attribute Crystals</h4>
        <p>Due to the addition of the Attribute Crystal, the maximum attribute values which can be endowed on weapon and armor has been increased as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Weapon: 150 → 300</li>
            <li>Armor: 300 → 600</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>The maximum attribute values which can be endowed using existing attribute stones (ie: Fire Stone, Earth Stone, Water Stone, etc…) have not changed.  Weapon attributes go up to 150, and armor attributes up to 300.</li>
            <li>Attribute Stones and Crystals enhance for the same amount.  On weapons, each Stone/Crystal gives a 5 point bonus.  On armor, each Stone/Crystal gives a 6 point bonus.</li>
            <li>Attribute Crystals can be crafted by using items obtained through collection as ingredients.</li>

            <li>Recipes for Icarus weapons</li>
            <li>Major ingredients of Icarus weapons.</li>

        <p>Purchasing these items requires special quest items obtained from the Seeds of Destruction and Infinity.</p>

        <h4>Armor Set Effect Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When one wears superior upper body armor and pairs it with other masterwork pieces from the same set, the character will receive both the superior set item bonuses as well as the individual masterwork bonuses.</li>
            <li>Masterwork tops are an exception to the above rule.  Because each masterwork top possesses its own specialized set of bonuses, pairing mixtures of masterwork and superior items with a masterwork top will not give you the superior set bonuses associated with the actual set.</li>
            <li>It has been changed so that a rare type upper armor is not manufactured during item creation.</li>
            <li>Existing masterwork upper body pieces can be exchanged for any other masterwork piece within the same set.  Or it can be exchanged for its superior equivelant (example: a  Masterwork Dynasty Breastplate can be exchange for a superior Dynasty Breastplate or a set of Masterwork Dynasty Boots).  All this is done through the Blacksmith of Mammon.</li>
