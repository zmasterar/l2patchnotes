            <h2 id="mail-update">1. Mail</h2>
            <div class="update">

                
                <p>The Mail System has been added in order to strengthen the player community and to increase the convenience of item trade. Through the Mail System, messages as well as items can be easily sent to other players.</p>
                <p>There are two types of mail: Regular and Payment Request.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Regular mail allows players to send a message to other players with or without an attached item.  Once the mail is sent, it can be checked by the recipient from the mail icon that appears on their screen. The cost for this type of mail is assumed by the player sending the mail.</li>
                    <li>Payment Request (also known as C.O.D) mail contains an attached item, and in order to retrieve the item the recipient needs to return the requested amount of Adena to the sender.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sending Mail</h4>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>You can access your mailbox by clicking the mail icon at the top of the system menu (Alt + X) or by typing /mailbox in your chat window.</li>
                    <li>A maximum of 8 items can be attached to each message and postage will increase depending on the weight of the attached items.</li>
                    <li>Sending and receiving mail is only available in a peace zone.</li>
                    <li>Mail will arrive at the recipient after 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Sent mail can be cancelled if the recipient has not yet opened the mail, if the mail has yet to be delivered, or if an attached item has not been claimed.</li>

                    <li>You must click on the Mail Type dropdown box in order to send COD mail.</li>
                    <li>The COD sender will receive the requested amount of adena directly in their inventory once the recipient hits the pay button.  This happens almost instantly.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Receiving Mail</h4>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The mail icon will appear when you have new mail and you can click this icon to check your newly received mail.  The mail icon appears just above your chat window.</li>
                    <li>An attached item cannot be claimed when you do not have enough available inventory slots or when receiving those items would cause your weight gauge to exceed 100%.  Clicking on the pay button will allow you to claim the item sent to you.  Once you click this button, the corresponding amount of adena disappears from your inventory.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Returning and Deleting Mail</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular mail without an attached item cannot be returned.  This type of mail can only be received or deleted.  You must open the mail first before it can be deleted.</li>
                    <li>Mail with an attached item can be returned or received, but it cannot be deleted.</li>
                    <li>Unchecked mail will automatically be returned after 15 days.  Please note that mail without an attached item will be automatically deleted, not returned.</li>
                    <li>Unchecked returned mail will be automatically deleted and the item will be transferred to the private warehouse after 15 days.  Payment Requests will be automatically returned if not accepted within 12 hours.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Freight</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The freight system has been replaced by the new Mail system.  Items that were stored in freight will be automatically placed into your personal warehouse during the update to Gracia Epilogue. If there are overflow items, players will need to remove items from their warehouse in order to access these additional items.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>The Command Channel matching room is created when a Command Channel leader opens the party matching window (/partymatching), and the Command Channel matching room is closed when the Command Channel leader closes the Command Channel matching window.</li>
<li>A list of players who joined the Command Channel matching room with their current party status, location, level range, and class can be viewed.</li>

            <div class="update">
                
                <p>Different from clan-centric castle sieges, Territory Wars give regular players the ability to affect the dominance of a territory by participating in battles disguised as a mercenary. Participating in a Territory War will allow players to purchase new special items useful in PvP, character progression, etc.</p>
                <p>Special items are sold by the Territory Manager located in the main city of each territory. Also, S80 territory guard necklace, ring, and earring with special characteristics, and hair accessories have been added.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are new items available through the Territory Manager and Mercenary Captains in each town.</li>

                <h4>Skill Transfer</h4>
                <p>Skill transfer is designed to expand the usefulness of healers in party situations.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>This system allows the dedicated healer classes (Cardinal, Eva's Saint, Shillien Saint) to acquire skills from the other two healer classes.  For example: Skill Transfer would allow a Cardinal to learn the skill Party Recall.  Or it would allow a Shillien Saint to learn the skill Mass Resurrection.</li>
                    <li>Skill Transfer can be learned through the usual class trainer NPC's (priest, high priest, magister, etc.). One Holy Pomander is required to learn each skill. Holy Pomander is now received as a 3rd class change quest reward.  But if you have already completed this quest prior to the update, it will be automatically be placed in your character's warehouse.</li>
                    <li>Skills acquired through this means can be removed by a skill trainer for 10,000,000 adena. The Holy Pomander spent on the skill will be returned when the skill is removed.</li>
                    <li>Some skills acquired through Skill Transfer can be enchanted.</li>
                    <li>Subclassed healers can also take advantage of Skill Transfer as long as they meet the requirements.</li>

        <h2 id="zaken-update">9. Zaken Raid Changes</h2>
            <div class="update">

                <p>The Zaken Raid has been redesigned as an Instanced Zone in order to provide more raid opportunities to more players.  Players can now choose to fight Daytime Zaken or Nighttime Zaken.</p>
                <h4>Entry Requirements</h4>
                <h5>Daytime Zaken</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Between 1 and 3 parties (9 - 27 players) can challenge Daytime Zaken.  If only one party is raiding, then it must be a full party of 9 people.</li>
                    <li>When entering with a single party, the party leader can talk to the Pathfinder NPC to gain entry.</li>

                    <li>When entering with 2 or 3 parties, the command channel leader can talk to the Pathfinder NPC to gain entry.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Nighttime Zaken</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A raid force between 8 and 50 parties (72 - 450 players) can challenge Nighttime Zaken.</li>
                    <li>The raid channel leader can use the Pathfinder Agent to enter.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Progression Method - Daytime Zaken</h4>
                <p>Each corridor within the ship now contains a barrel with a candle on it.  Within the allotted time, players must light the various candles.  The candles will give clues to Zaken's location.  A red candle means he is not there.  A blue candle means he is close.  In the end, there will be 4 blue candles.  The room surrounded by these candles is where you will find Zaken.  But please be cautious in choosing which candles to light.  Lighting too many red candles will cause Zaken to become stronger.  In addition, too many red candles will also cause more and more of his henchmen to appear.  But likewise, the fewer red candles that are lit, and the faster that Zaken is defeated, the better your rewards will be.</p>
                <h4>Raid Time</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Daytime Zaken raid time limit is 60 minutes, and the instance is reset every 3 days (Wednesday and Saturday at 6:30am).</li>
                    <li>Nighttime Zaken raid time limit is 360 minutes, and the instance is reset every 7 days (Wednesday at 6:30am).</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Other Information</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may teleport to Zaken's chamber entrance through NPC Somulita located at Giran Harbor.</li>
                    <li>Zaken's chamber gate is no longer used to access the lower decks of the ship.  Instead, players must now speak to the Pathfinder agent.</li>
                    <li>A Pathfinder NPC is stationed on the deck of Zaken's ship, near the chamber gate entrance.  This NPC offers information and requirements for the Zaken raid, and contains a teleport link that will send you into the instance.</li>
                    <li>If pulled too far away, Zaken's henchmen will return to their original locations.</li>

                    <li>The rewards for defeating Zaken have been modified.</li>
                </ul>
